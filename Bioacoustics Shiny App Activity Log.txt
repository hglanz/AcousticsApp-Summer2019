Bioacoustics Shiny App Activity Log
Michal Golovanevsky 

Week 1:
	-Researched bioacoustics
		-What is a spectrogram?
		-What is an oscillogram?
		-What is a spectrum?
	-Watched the 7 video tutorial series on the Raven website and followed along using their 
	demo files 
	-Uploaded the .wav files in the repository into RavenLite and replicated the process shown 
	in the videos 
	-Compared some of the RavenLite results to our Shiny App and played around with 
	different files
	-Read through the R code and worked on understanding majority of the code
	-Researched bugs in the Shiny App and tried to ÒbreakÓ the App
		-New bugs observed: 
			-After uploading a file need if you click on one of the preloaded options 
			nothing happens, need to reset to change the file. 
	-Worked on fixing stylistic problems with the app
		-Made images in the help options align with text and adjust based on screen size
		-Researched font size/style problem
Week 2:
	- Began Researching audio playback
		- Got a working version of the app's playback on Google Chrome
		- Fixed font differences in the app
		- Published shinyapp to my own account
			-audio works everywhere but Safari browser
		- Researched how to get the wav files to play on RStudio webpage, potential solutions:
			-convert wav to mp3
			-if can't convert using R code, run a shell script to convert
			-use beepr() package
		
Week 3:
	- Worked on Audio Play starting and ending at a certain time
		- now it displays the time the audio is set to and is also synced with the spectrogram
		- it generates a new audio that is shorter rather than just move the curser so we can set an end date as well
	- researched different segmentation or change detection methods
	- added a new tab for segmentation
		- using autodetec() from warbleR
			- a bit on the slower side
		- added Min/Max duration, amplitude threshold, and min/max frequency to the sidebar
		- added help buttons to explain each item on the sidebar
		- generates graph but doesn't always do a great job segmenting
		- good example is dolphin file with min time = 0.2 seconds
	- rounded numbers on slidebars 
	- made 2 red lines thicker/bolder
		- also added that to the spectrogram
 	- Made formula in text stand out more in overlapping help
 	- Changed "loosing" to "losing" in zero padding help

Week 4:
	- potentially fixed max db being 0
		- unsure of the lower limit (using alim)
		- need an example of when this happens
	- researched horizontal black lines on spectrogram to also add to spectrum
		- built-in feature for spectro, doesn't exist for spec, can make them artificially for both but doing it just 			for spectrum won't match the spectro. Look at difference between the sin files
	- need more details for "Option to specify start time and duration instead of start time and end time"
	- Condensed inputs on left
		- made min/max pairs be on the same line
	- researched why doesn't it show amplitude for all frequences in dolphin file
		- potential solution would be to do a seperate if statement just for the dolphin files so there's no flim
	- fixed: "Choosing a different window function should change both the spectrum and the spectrogram, but it currently 		doesn't change the spectrum"
	- need more details: "Make pictures smaller and consistent across help options (use size of right graph in windowed 		signal as template)" 
	- fixed: f_s in sampling rate should be an actual subscript
	- Windows.R doesn't work when run by itself, why?
